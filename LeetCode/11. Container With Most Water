You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int maxWater = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int width = right - left;
            int currHeight = min(height[left], height[right]);
            int area = width * currHeight;

            maxWater = max(maxWater, area);

            // Move the pointer with smaller height
            if (height[left] < height[right])
                left++;
            else
                right--;
        }

        return maxWater;
    }
};
